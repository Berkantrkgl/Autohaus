# Autohaus

This project was done within the scope of the project course at the Turkish-German University. In the project, the vehicle tracking system of a car dealership was revived. A UI design has not been made for the project. Only Request Mapping was done with Spring Boot and requests were made with Postman.

* MVC (Model View Controller) approach was adopted as the design pattern in the project. We tried to stick to it as much as we could.
* All CRUD operations have been tried to be implemented.
